  'Offer kinds with no overlap are different deals. A specific benefit (onboard credit, gratuities, a gift, airfare, kids sail free) never matches a website deal that only promises generic discounts, savings or bonuses.',
  "If the incoming deal keeps the website deal's offer and adds more (credit, a percentage, an upgrade, an end date), it is the same deal: update. A vague website deal (\"special solo savings\", \"all-inclusive upgrade\") matches the concrete version of the same benefit (\"50% off the single supplement\", \"comp all-inclusive package\").",

  'Already live: same offer, same amounts, percentages and nights, same end date (or both open-ended). A website deal that has everything the incoming deal has plus a little more (wine vs wine and chocolates) is still already live.',
  'Wording never matters: website titles are marketing rewrites. Ignore promo/booking codes (PWD, BC100, LASTMINUTE), internal labels (TLN, OCAPP, LTO, GTY, PBP, PHY, P2P), "capacity controlled", "limited availability" and which sailings or tours qualify.',
